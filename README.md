## FAQ-Bot -> Holo
The FAQ Bot hosted by the government of BC is a keyword matcher which provides answers to basic questions and provides links to additional information. 

The FAQ Bot also acts as a host to find new release information for Microsoft Teams

## Version Information
Version 1.3.0 looked to move from a Teams Q&A bot into a generic FAQ Bot for information pertaining to the cloud. 

In this change we looked into the addition of a tab which provides information such as new features
We removed the static tab located at the top of the bot which lead to Azure. A unneeded tab as it only caused confusion in those using the bot

## Bot Template Link
This bot is built from the microsoft-teams-apps-faqplus bot which can be found here:
